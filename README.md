HAS-Scope-Code

## Overview
This repository contains two code for two programs. The first is the Arduino code that runs on the Arduino microcontroller that is connected to the stepper motor drivers of the telescope. The other program is an INDI Server Driver that mediates between Stellarium and the Arduino. 


### nijuyon-scope-sim
The Arduino code uses the AccelStepper library to control the stepper motor drivers.
